    question: "Q: What does the compost bin system do?",
    answer:
      "A: The compost bin system processes organic waste such as food scraps and plant materials and converts them into nutrient-rich fertilizer through controlled composting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q: What types of waste can be placed in the compost bin?",
    answer:
      "A: The system accepts biodegradable materials such as fruit and vegetable waste, leaves, grass clippings, and other organic matter. Non-biodegradable materials like plastics, metals, and chemicals should not be added.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q: How does the system monitor the composting process?",
    answer:
      "A: The system uses sensors to monitor parameters such as temperature, humidity, and gas levels to ensure optimal conditions for efficient composting and safe operation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q: Does the compost bin require regular maintenance?",
    answer:
      "A: Minimal maintenance is required. Users need to periodically add organic waste, ensure proper moisture levels, and collect the finished fertilizer as instructed by the system.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q: Is the system odor-free?",
    answer:
      "A: The system is designed to minimize odor through proper airflow and controlled composting conditions. Odors may occur if non-recommended materials are added.",
  },
  {
    question: "Q: Can users track compost data and fertilizer output?",
    answer:
      "A: Yes. The system includes a monitoring interface that allows users to view compost status, historical data, and fertilizer output records.",
